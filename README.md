a) Transform the given image using Rotation, Affine, Homography transforms.
You can test with different parameters in each case. 

b) Estimate the homography / affine transform using examples created in the first assignment.

For part b)  will have to manually select corresponding points in the reference image and the transformed image.
Explore some mouse based selection tools in whichever programming environment you work with.
